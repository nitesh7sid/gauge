# Gauge - Performance benchmarking tool for Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum 

This tool is a performance benchmarking tool built for characterizing the performance of Hyperledger Fabric v1.1 platform and Quorum v2.0.0. The benchmarking engine is forked off Caliper (currently <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/caliper/tree/master/src">Hyperledger Caliper</a>), developed by Huawei Technologies. Tool includes modifications to the Caliper Benchmarking engine to be able to send transactions at high send rates. Modifications to the original Caliper source code are listed [here](./docs/caliper-changes.md).
